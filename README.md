# Cashew
Cashew is a .NET library for caching responses easily with an HttpClient through an API that is simple and elegant yet powerful.
There's support out of the box for the awesome [CacheManager](https://github.com/MichaCo/CacheManager) via the `Cashew.Adapters.CacheManager` package. Its aim is to focus on the HTTP part of caching and not worrying about how stuff is stored, meaning no half-arsed cache implementations!

Cashew targets .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 1.1 (.NET Core, Mono, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, UWP and [more](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md)) meaning it can be used on all sorts of devices.

# Installation
The latest versions of the packages are available on NuGet. To install, run the following command if you want to roll your own cache:
```
PM> Install-Package Cashew
```
or the command below if you want to utilise the power of [CacheManager](https://github.com/MichaCo/CacheManager)
```
PM> Install-Package Cashew.Adapters.CacheManager
```

## Customisation
Cashew provides a lot of customisation opportunities for its users. The most important ones are listed below:

# Usage
For more in-depth information on how to use Cashew, please refer to our [wiki](https://github.com/joakimskoog/Cashew/wiki).

## Configuring HttpClient
```csharp
//All it takes is one line to configure the whole thing!
var httpClient = new HttpClient(new HttpCachingHandler(cache, new HttpStandardKeyStrategy(cache)));
```


## Use any cache store
```csharp
//We feel like caching the HTTP responses in an SQL store (for some reason) and have therefore created our own SqlCache
var sqlCache = new SqlCache();

//We pass our newly created sql cache in the constructor and watch the magic happen
var httpCachingHandler = new HttpCachingHandler(sqlCache, keyStrategy);
```

## Decide how cache keys are created
```csharp
//We have created our own strategy that creates keys out of request URI:s
var uriKeyStrategy = new RequestUriKeyStrategy();

//We pass our newly created key strategy in the constructor and watch the magic happen!
var httpCachingHandler = new HttpCachingHandler(memoryCache, uriKeyStrategy);
```

## Cacheable status codes
```csharp
//We only want to cache responses with status 200
httpCachingHandler.CacheableStatusCodes = new[] { HttpStatusCode.OK };
```
