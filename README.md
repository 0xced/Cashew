# Usage

## Configuring HttpClient


## Use any cache store
```csharp
//We feel like caching the HTTP responses in an SQL store (for some reason) and have therefore created our own SqlCache
var sqlCache = new SqlCache();

//We pass our newly created sql cache in the constructor and watch the magic happen
var httpCachingHandler = new HttpCachingHandler(sqlCache, keyStrategy);
```

## Decide how cache keys are created
```csharp
//We have created our own strategy that creates keys out of request URI:s
var uriKeyStrategy = new RequestUriKeyStrategy();

//We pass our newly created key strategy in the constructor and watch the magic happen!
var httpCachingHandler = new HttpCachingHandler(memoryCache, uriKeyStrategy);

```

## Cacheable status codes
```csharp
//We only want to cache responses with status 200
httpCachingHandler.CacheableStatusCodes = new[] { HttpStatusCode.OK };
```
